# MAO-Calculator
This was used as a real world learning project using HTML,CSS/Bootstrap, and javascript to do something I would normally just leave to excel. I wanted my wife to be able to access the mao calculator on the fly from anywhere. Very basic, but I learn more and more with each small project :-).
